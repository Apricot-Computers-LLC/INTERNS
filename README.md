# INTERNS
Interns earn reputation points (RP). The RP system is designed for student interns, particularly foreign graduate students, since they cannot technically work and earn a typical salary as a student. Instead of traditional pay, interns earn benefits and a path to sponsorship by accumulating RPs, aligning with visa regulations. Payoneer is needed to have cash transferred to your account.

Here’s a tailored RP (Reputation Points) Benefits System for Student Interns, especially foreign graduate students who need to earn their way into full benefits while complying with visa/work regulations. These perks are designed to replace traditional pay with career-building rewards and a path to sponsorship.
